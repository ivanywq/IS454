            "- Contains notes or comments specifically regarding **auditing** or **verifying** charges on medical bills.\n"

            "- Look for terms like 'audit', 'reconciliation', 'review', 'charges audited', 'summary of charges', 'quantity', 'charged', 'why so many', or 'charges correct'.\n"
            "- **Important**: If the text includes phrases like 'Revise invoice', 'It is correct', or audit-related questions (e.g., 'why so many?', 'is the charge correct?'), this is likely a Bill Audit Form rather than an Invoice.\n\n"

            "- Any document labeled as a **Tax Invoice** should be classified as an Invoice, regardless of the specific items or services listed.\n"
            "- Primarily used for **billing purposes**, listing items, prices, discounts, and total amounts.\n"
            "- Includes billing-related details like **hospital charges**, **consumables**, **bed charges**, or other general medical service fees.\n"
            "- Look for terms like **'Invoice Number'**, **'Due Date'**, or **'Payment Due'**.\n"
            "- Excludes detailed audit-specific comments but may include general notes for billing accuracy.\n\n"
            "**Letter of Guarantee**:\n"
            "- A formal document ensuring **payment or coverage** from an insurer or healthcare provider.\n"
            "- Look for terms like 'guarantee', 'coverage', 'guarantor', 'terms of coverage', or 'formal letter'.\n"
            "- Typically includes **names, conditions, and guarantees**.\n\n"
            "**Medical Report**:\n"
            "- Contains detailed medical information such as **diagnosis**, **treatment**, **clinical notes**, and **patient history**.\n"
            "- Look for terms like 'diagnosis', 'treatment plan', 'medical history', 'clinical notes', or 'symptoms'.\n"
            "- Usually includes **doctorâ€™s notes**, **patient health information**, or **treatment details**.\n"
            "- If the document contains consumable lists, medical supplies, or references to items used during treatment without billing or invoice details, categorize it as Medical Report.\n\n"

            "3. Pay attention to **key terms** and **the absence of expected words** (e.g., missing 'Tax Invoice' should raise suspicion of a misclassification).\n\n"
