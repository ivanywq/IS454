We have informed  the nurse to limit the discharge  medication  to enough  supply to last till the next TCU.
However,  according  to interpreter,  the discharge  doctor  strongly  advice for patient  to collect  the prescribed  amount,
as the doctor  say patient  will likely need to stay in Singapore  for a while for treatment,  and he will need these
medication.
