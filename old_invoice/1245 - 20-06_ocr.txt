RE:
Mdra is currently  on intravenous  antibiotics
and hospitallsed  in Mount Elizabeth  Hospital.
For the past 1 week, the patient has remain afebrile  and the procaicitonin
{an indicator  of infection)  has been gradually  coming  down.
Last night, the patient  spike the ternperature.
On checking  the procalci  tonin today, it has gone up compared  to yesterday.
] had to call in Or Lam Mun San to review  the antibiotics  to see if further
adjustment  is needed.
It is better to have early intervention  rather  to wait for the infection  to settle
in as delayed  corrective  action can lead to even further extension  of her
hospitalisation.
Thank  you.

RE;
The patient is currently  warded in Mount Elizabeth  Hospital and receiving
both antibacterial  as well as antifungal  treatment.
Her fever has subsided  and the procalcitonin  has come down to normal.
D; Lam Mun San — Infectious  Disease  Consultant,  has suggested  that we
should consider  referring  to both a urologist  as well as a gynaecologist  to
explain  the cause of her recurrent  bladder  infections.
We have sk d Dr Lisa Wong who pfeviously  operated  on the patient to
see Mdm
We are also seeking  permission  to 'efer her to a urologist  for consideration
of a cystoscopic  evaluation  to rule out any possible  cause for her recurrent
urinary  tract infection.
Thank  you.

The patient is currently  warded  in Mount Elizabeth  Hospital. She was referred for a urological  opinion and
. was seen by me on 10 June 2020,
She has recurrent  and persistent  bladder infizctions  and requires evaluation  for any underlying  cause.
” Her kidneys had previously been assessed  with a CT scan. To complete  the evaluation,  she would aiso
benefit  from cystoscopy.
' In addition,  she also requires  assessment  of the functional  status of her lower urinary tract. This can be
accomplished  by daily recording  of her urinary  frequency  — volume  chart, uroflowmetry  and measurement  of
‘her post-void  residual  urinary volume,
I seek permission  to continue  to review her in the ward and arrange for cystoscop  ye
Thank you.

Follow-up  review on 12 June 2020.
As mentioned  in my previous  communication,  a urinary frequency  — volume chart was required. However,
her urinary  chart was incomplete.  The patient  tended to void in diapers  and data on urination  were not
captured. She apparently  is blind and needs assistance  to visit the toilet. She was thus advised  to inform the
ward nurses whenever  she needs to urinate,  so as to allow nurses to record her urinary  chart.
Inital tests showed  variable  volumes  of post-void  residual  ure (PVRU). If her PVRU is persistently  high,
she would require intermittent  catheterisation.
More information  about her urination  are still needed and. these will aid in delivering  care to the patient. She
would benefit  with urological  reviews  3 times a week. This can be reduced  when her urological  status
improves.
Thank you.

The patient is currently  warded in Mount Elizabeth  Hospital  and receiving

The patient  is doing well. Her fever has subsided.
My advice is for her to carry out a cystoscopic  evaluation  before she is
discharged  from hospital.
Once the cystoscopy  is cleared, my plan is for her to be discharged  and to
continue  treatment  on an outpatient  basis.
| have just spoken to Dr Toh Khai Lee — consultant  urologist,  and he has
confirmed  that he will be doing the cystoscopic  evaluation  this week.
Thank  you.

Mdm underwent  cystoscopy  on 16 June 2020. It showed mild inflammatory  changes consistent  with
her recent history of cystitis. There was no evidence  of papillary  lesion, velvety  patches  or stones. Both
ureteric  orifices  appeared  normal.
As mentioned  in my previous  communication  dated 12 June 2020, her urinary  frequency  and volume were
charted. Her post-void  residual  urinary volumes  were frequently  high, as much as 220 ml. As such, she had
been advised  post-void  clean intermittent  catheterisation  (CIC).
However,  she apparently  is visually  impaired  and thus would require assistance  for CIC. While in the
hospital,  the ward nurses can assist. Upon discharge,  she would require a helper in this regard.
May I request  permission  to review her 1 more time this week.
Thank  you.
