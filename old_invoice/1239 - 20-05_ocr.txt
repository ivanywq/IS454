Subject  Title Memo
Dear UAE Embassy
This letter provides  an update  of
He has been admitted  since 10 Feb 2020 for acute graft versus host disease of his gut, a
complication  related to his recent allogeneic  stem cell transplant  for his lymphoma  on
20/8/2019.
He has responded  to the treatment  given to him and is making good progress.  We may be
able to discharge  him within the next few days. However,  he is NOT FIT to fly back to his home
country  yet, as he still needs very intensive  and regular  outpatient  follow-up  and treatment.
There is a possibility  that his acute GVHD may flare and he might need to be hospitalised.
As this is a serious post transplant  related complication  that may be lethal if not monitored  or
treated by an experienced  transplant  team, we strongly  discourage  him to fly back to his home
country  now,
Thank you for your kind understanding.

Dear UAE colleagues:
The above mentioned  is a gentleman  with relapsed refractory  T cell lymphoma,  currentlyin  complete  remission
post allogeneic  transplant  from his matched related donor (brother). His post transplant  course has been
complicated  by Grade |V Graft versus host disease of the gastrointestinal  tract, which was steroid refractory.  This
has led to his prolonged  hospitalization  and need for parenteral  nutrition  as well as high doses of steroids.
He is currently  improving  after nearly 6 weeks of intravenous  steroids and use of second line agent ruxolitinib.
Grade 1V steroid refractory  GVHD is potentially  life threatening  and necessitates  management  in a specialized
transplant  centre. His immunosuppression  will need to be weaned off slowly and he will need to be closely
monitored.  In addition, he also has cytomegalovirus  reactivation  due to his immunosuppression  medications  and
is currently  on antiviral  treatment.
Given the complexity  of condition,  we would like to request to only send back to UAE once
his Steroids  are weaned off (this may take another  2-3 months)  and his infective  issues have resolved.
Thank you very much for the understanding  and please do not hesitate to contact me as necessary.

To Whorn it May Concern

Date 05-Jun-2020
TO : UAE Embassy
Dear Sir/Ma‘am,
was recently  discharged  from acute GVHD of his gastrointestinal  tract. In the
same admission,  he was also treated  for his CMV reactivation  and viremia.
CMV PCR was trended  and despite  on standard  oral treatment  with Valganciclovir,  the titre did not
return to normal and lastest results still showing  a persistently  high titre results instead.
We are concern  of CMV drug resistance  and have sent a test for it. Since it will take more than 2
weeks before the results turn around,  we have decided  to offer in treating  hirn with CMV
intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIG), with hope to reduce the titre and to prevent  the risk of
reactivation  causing potential  CMV disease.
CMV {VIG is a high cost drug however,  and he will require  a dose of infusion  twice a week, with each
dose costing  approximately  SGD 2,000 (ie. SGD 4,000 per week).
This therefore  is to seek your permission  please, if we could proceed  with the treatment  as we
foresee  the potential  benefit  over Mr Ahmed Khaled.
Thank you for your support  and consideration.
Regards,
Jedidah  Lieow (Yuuki),  Advanced  Practice  Nurse
and Dr Poon Limei Michelle,  Senior  Consultant
