Mdm  is currently on intravenous antibiotics 
and hospita!lsed in Mount Elizabeth Hospital. 
For the past 1 week, the patient has remain afebrile and the procalcitonin 
(an indicator of infection) has been gradually coming down. 
Last night, the patient spike the temperature. 
On checking the procalcitonin today, it has gone up compared to yesterday. 
I had to call in Dr Lam Mun San to review the antibiotics to see If further 
adjus tment is needed. 
It is better to have early intervention rather to wait for the infection to settle 
in as delayed corrective action can lead to even further extension of her 
hospitalisation . 
Thank you.

The patient is currently warded in Mount Elizabeth Hospital. She was referred for a urological opinion and 
was seen by me on 10 June 2020, 
She _has recurrent and persistent bladder infections and requires evaluation for any underlying cause. 
. . . 
Her kidneys had previously been assessed with a CT scan. To complete the evaluation, she would also 
benefit from cystoscopy. 
In addition, she also requires assessment of the functional status of her lower urinary tract. This can be 
accomplished by daily recording of her urinary frequency - volume chart, uroflowmetry and measurement of 
her post-void residual urinary volume. 
. . 
I seek permission to continue to review her in the ward and arrange for cystoscopy.. 
Thank you.

Follow-up review on 12 June 2020. www .mountelizabeth.com .sg 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 
As mentioned in my previous communication, a urinary frequency -- volume chart was required. However, 
her urinary chart was incomplete. The patient tended to void in diapers and data on urination were not 
captured. She apparently is blind and needs assistance to visit the toilet. She was thus advised to inform the 
ward nurses whenever she needs to urinate, so as to allow nurses to record her urinary chart. 
Inital tests showed variable volumes of post-void residual urine (PVRU). If her PVRU is persistently high, 
she would require intermittent catheterisation. 
More information about her urination are still needed and these will aid in delivering care to the patient. She 
would benefit with urological reviews 3 times a week. This can be reduced when her urological status 
improves. 
Thank you.

Mdm  underwent cystoscopy on 16 June 2020. It showed mild inflammatory changes consistent with 
her recent history of cystitis. There was no evidence of papillary lesion, velvety patches or stones. Both 
ureteric orifices appeared normal. 
As mentioned in my previous communication dated 12 June 2020, her urinary frequency and volume were 
charted. Her post-void residual urinary volumes were frequently high, as much as 220 ml. As such, she had 
been advised post-void clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC). 
However, she apparently is visually impaired and thus would require assistance for CIC. While in the 
hospital, the ward nurses can assist. Upon discharge, she would require a helper in this regard. 
May I request permission to review her l more time this week. 
Thank you. 
Your sincerely
