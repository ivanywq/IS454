RE: Discharge Summary-
Hi DrAziah 
We have informed the nurse to limit the discharge medication to enough supply to last till the next TCU. 
However, according to interpreter, the discharge doctor strongly advice for patient to collect the prescribed amount, 
as the doctor say patient will likely need to stay in Singapore for a while for treatment, and he will need these 
medication.
