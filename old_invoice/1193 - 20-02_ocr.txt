3. Neurogenic  bladder,  on clean intermittent  catheterization
4. Lagophthalmos  on regular  eye drops
MEDICAL  HISTORY
a) Initial Presentation
was born to consanguineous  parents  (father's  father is uncle of mother's  mother)  and is the 4th
child, with 3 healthy  siblings  - 10 year old girl, 9 year old boy and 5 year old boy. There were no
pregnancy  or birth complications.
Spasms  started from the age of 8 months,  with jerking  followed  by stiffening  for 1-2 seconds,  and
some rhythmic  hand jerks and eye movements.  These occurred  several  times every day in clusters  of
5-10 at a time and happened  throughout  the day, more on wakening  from sleep. He went to Korea for
treatment  and spasms reduced  in number  but never stopped.  Semiology  had changed,  with initial
subtle  spasms  but subsequently  having  more violent  spasms  with vocalization.  Sometimes  he showed
oromotor  automatisms  (chewing)  after the spasm. The spasms got worse when mother stopped
vigabatrin  and stiripentol  due to lack of supply. No other type of seizures  had been noted by parents.
b) Developmental  History
Gross Motor  - head holding  started at 4 months,  he was able to sit with support  and roll completely
at 6 months, then with onset of spasm he lost those milestones  and has not been able to sit
independently  until now.
Fine motor  - he used to reach for objects  before  8 months,  now does notreach  for anything.
Social  - was able to fix and follow  at 2-3 mother,  social smile at 2-3 months,  then with onset of spasm,
lost these milestones  also.
Language  - used to babble  before,  lost babbling  after 8 months.
Other problems  include  oropharyngeal  dysphagia,  with difficulty  in swallowing  solids and choking  on
liquid. He has bilateral  otitis media,  for which he was advised  to use a hearing  aid,
Hearing  is impaired  and visual regard is poor, though ERG and VEP done were normal.
He has evolving  spasticity  and dystonia,  and was treated  with Botox in South Korea, He had not had
physiotherapy  for the last 6 months  prior to presenting  at KKH.
c) Treatment  and Investigation  HistoryReg No 52839081C

Following  onset of spasms  he was started on levetiracetam  and valproate  in the UAE in Feb 2016. He
was referred  to Samsung  Medical  centre, South Korea In Oct 2016 and diagnosed  with Leigh disease
with MFF gene mutation.
Investigations  done in South Korea on 01/2018:  MRI brain showed  atrophy  and white matter  loss and
EEG was reported  to show epileptic  encephalopathy  in keeping  with Lennox-Gastaut  Syndrome.
He was admitted  for epilepsy  monitoring  at KK Hospital  in November  2018 to characterise  his seizures
and had liver function  test, full blood count, renal panel,  lactate  and ammonia  done which showed  no
significant  abnormalities.
During epllepsy monitoring,  multiple episodes of epileptic  spasms and tongue myoclonus  were
recorded.  The EEG was not suggestive  of Lennox-Gastaut  Syndrome.  His Vigabatrin  was titrated  up as
follows:  Vigabatrin  250mg  OM and 500mg  ON (08/11/18-10/11/18),  then S00mg  OM and 1000mg  ON
(11/11/18-13/11/18)  then 1000 mg BD to continue.

diet/KD
At review on 15th November  2018, spasrns  had improved  following  the increase  in Vigabatrin,  from
30+ spasms  per day previously  to 20 or so a day. Spasms  were less forceful  and shorter  and occurred
more in day and less at night, tending  to occur in daytime and on waking and sometimes  in sleep

possibly with arousal. There was slightly less clustering  of spasms with some single spasms. No
prolonged  seizures  were noted, duration  was at most 5 seconds.
Parents were advised to titrate up existing medications  and commence  stiripentol  when it arrived,
then to wean down valproate.  Stiripentol  was initlated  with some improvement  of selzures.  However
his seizure frequency  remained  high. He was recommended  for the ketogenic  diet in view of his
refractory  seizures  and mitochondrial  aetiology.  Ketogenic  diet was initiated  following  insertion  of
gastrostomy  on 18/4/19  with some improvement  but persistent  seizures,
He was recommended  for vagus nerve stimulator  Implantation  or corpus callosotomy  and referred  to
Neurosurgery  for counselling  on treatment  options.
Parents  elected  for vagus nerve stimulator  implantation,  which was performed  on 14/10/19.  It was
switched  on on 22/10/2019  and settings  titrated  up.

Seizures  were slgnificantly  improved  with VNS implantation  and titration.
d) Neurorehabilitation
He was referred  for neurorehabilitation  and assessment  by Dr Ng Zhi Min showed  GMFCS  class V, FMS
N,N,N. He had poor head control,  would make attempts  to turn, and had bed mobility  with moderate
assistance.  He did standing  exercises  on stander  while in South Korea but stopped  after leaving  South
Korea. He sat with maximum  assistance  and was completely  dependent  for activities  of daily Ilving.
MACS was level V, with no active grasp of object/ reaching.  For language  he was CFCS V - cries when
In pain/ discomfort.  He was fed mashed  food via spoon (EDACS IV). Social domain  was delayed  with
no social smile since 8 months  of age. He had a buggy and bilateral  solid ankle foot orthoses.
Sleep was noted to be better following  admission.  There had been no prior hip surveillance  before.
Examination  was as follows:  OFC 46 cm
He was alert, with no visual regard,  intermittent  nystagmus  noted and no facial weakness.  Tone was
increased  in biceps, wrist extensors,  hamstrings  and ankles, with brisk deep tendon reflexes and
plantars bilaterally  upgoing.  No visual regard/  tracking  was seen and no blink on direct threat. No
cooing/  vocalization  was noted thaugh  he cried when being touched.
Dyskinetic  movements  were seen in the upper limbs but range of movement  was full. Hypertaxity  of
joints with generalized  truncal hypotonia  was noted with limb dyskinesia,  Lower limbs tended to be
in extensor  posture when agitated.  Galeazzi  was negative.  Hip flexion  was 120 degree  bilaterally  and
Thomas  test was negative  bilaterally.  Hip abduction  was 80 degrees  (knees flexed),  80 degrees  (knees
extended)  and there were no knee flexion contractures.  Popliteal  angle was 40 degrees and Ankle
dorsiflexion  (KE/KF)  0/20 degrees  with tight gastrocnemius.
Neurorehabilitation  plan was for:TM

1. Continue  with hip surveillance  with yearly  pelvis AP Xray
2, PT: Parents were taught home exercise program.  To continue home exercise programme  and
assisted  standing  with bilateral  knee gaiters and ankle-foot-orthosis  (AFO). Planned  to do Botulinum
toxin injections  to bilateral  lower limbs to improve  tolerance  of AFO).
3, OT: Child has been fitted with a well-supported  wheelchair.  He was given bilateral  hand splints for
positioning  of the hands.
4. ST: He Is on full PEG feeding.
e) Recent  Issues
has been admitted  to KKH since 9/12/19,  with clinical Issues of Clavispora  lusitaniae  Catheter-
Associated  Urinary Tract Infection  (CAUTI)  and presumed  aspiration  pneumonia  with right upper lobe
lung collapse.
He initially presented  with desaturation,  lethargy  and carbon dioxide retention  on 9/12/19.  He was
intubated  for 3 days and extubated  successfully  on 11/12/19.  CT Brain done on 9/12/19  to evaluate
his decreased  consclousness  showed dilated ventricles  with no obvious mass obstruction,  likely
secondary  to the braln atrophy.  Lumbar  puncture  was done which showed  normal opening  pressure
of 17 em H20 and unremarkable  CSF profile, He completed  1 week of intravenous  Fluconazole  with
repeat  urine culture  showing  no growth.
He presented  with another episode of desaturation,  decreased consciousness  and hypercarbla
requiring  re-intubation  on 15/12/19.  Chest radiograph  done showed  a right upper lobe collapse  and
he was treated as for presumed  asplratlon  pneumonia  and given a week of oral Augmentin.  He was
extubated  successfully  on the 17/12/49,  and started on non-invasive  ventilation  (BIPAP},
A Pulse oximetry  split-study  done on 23/12/19  demonstrated  a desaturation  index of 7.8 withSpO2
nadir of 86% and mean SpO2 96.8% on room air, with improvement  in desaturation  index and SpO2
nadir while on non-invasive  support  (BIPAP 12/6 Rate 20 on room air).
A physiclan  discussion  was held on the 27/12/19,  and it was agreed that based on the pulse oximetry
study results, Saif would benefit from home non-invasive  ventilatory  support  given his underlying
medical  conditions.
A repeat pulse oximetry  study on 27/12/19  with BiPAP 12/6 Rate 20 FiO2 21% showed acceptable
results:  desaturation  index of 1.9 with SpO2 nadir of 95% and mean Sp02 of 97.5%.
CURRENT  STATUS
- _ BIPAP mask non-invasive  ventilation  set at 12/6 Rate 20 FiO2 21%
- Thick nasal and oral secretions  requiring  regular  suctioning  every 2-3 hours
- Ketogentc  diet via gastrostomy  every 3 hourly x 6 times: Ketocal 15 g, Beneprotein  1g and

Dear Sir / Mdm
SPECIALIST  MEDICAL  REPORT FOR
is a delightful  boy who has background  history of Leigh’s disease with poorly
controlled  epileptic  spasm. | first reviewed  him on 8 November  2018 when he was
admitted  to Ki Women’s  and Children’s  Hospital (KKH}, Singapore  electively  for EEG
monitoring.  He then received  regular inpatient  and outpatient  therapy  sessions  in KKH
from November  2018 to February  2020.
While he gets his epileptic  spasms better controlled  in Singapore,  the main goals of
neurorenabilitation  were as follows:
® To optimize  management  of spasticity
° To optimize  bone health and hip alignment  through  proper seating  and weight
bearing  program  with appropriate  equipment
® To limit complications  such as skin sores and fimb contractures
showed  signs of neuroregression.
Gross Motor
He was reported  to have head control at 4 months  and able to sit witn support  and roll
completely  at 6 months.  With onset of spasm, he lost these milestones.  At first review,
he had poor head and trunk control but attempted  to roll with moderate  assistance.
With time, he had less spontaneous  limb movements.  In the last year, he remained  at
Gross motor function  scale (GMES)  V and Functional  Mobility  Scale (FMS) N,N,N.

Hyperlaxity  of joints with generalized  truncal hypotonia  was noted with limb dyskinesia.  Lower
limbs tended to be in extensor  posture when agitated. He developed  right more than left
equinovarus  ankle deformities,  Parents  were taught  home exercise program.  In order to improve
’s tolerance  of wearing his ankle-foot-orthosis  (AFO) to continue his standing program,
Botulinum  toxin injections  were given on 18 April 2019 to the following  muscles:
» Bilateral  medial hamstring
2 Bilateral  medial and lateral gastrocnemius
® Right tibialis posterior
Botulinum  toxin injections  were repeated  on 15 January  2020 to the following  muscles:
* Bilateral  rnedia!  gastrocnemius
» Right tibialis posterior
Hip surveillance  was performed;  Migration  index was acceptable  on pelvis Xray in November  2018
put X-ray showed  bilateral  hip subluxation  with migration  index 50% in October  2019. There was
no pain detected  on moving  the hips and no limitation  in performing  perineal  care and hygiene.
Fine motor
He used to reach for objects before 8 months,  and later lost his fine motor skills. He was assessed
to be Manual Ability Classification  System (MACS) V and was given bilateral hand splints for
positioning  of his hands to prevent  further deformity.  Dyskinetic  movements  were seen in the
upper limbs.
Social
He was reported  to be able to fix and follow at 2-3 months  with social smile at 2-3 months,  then
with onset of spasm, Jost these milestones.  He was assessed  to have poor visual fixation and
tracking,  likely cerebral  visual impairment.  He also had bilateral  hearing  impairment.
Language

Swallowing
When was first reviewed  in November  2018, he had delayed  oromotor  skills but was stifl
accepting  mashed  food and puree via spoon. He was assessed  to be at Eating and Drinking  Ability
Classification  System (EDACS)  lV. Video Fluoroscopy  Swallow  Study (VFSS) done on 19 November
2018 showed  that he had moderate  oropharyngeal  dysphagia.  By January  2019, he became  more
drowsy  and was dependent  on nasogastric  tube feeding.  He was then assessed  to have high risk
of aspiration  with severe oropharyngeal  dysphagia,  EDACS V. He underwent  gastrostomy  and
fundoplication  in April 2019. Since then, he had been on full gastrostomy  feeding.
Seating
Seating  trial was done for and a custom-fitted  wheelchair  and a neck collar were prescribed
for him. These equipment  helped in positioning  of his body in sitting.
Sleep
had poor sleep associated  with sleep spasms.  His sleep improved  with initiation  of Melatonin
and better control  of his seizures.
Recommendations
a We recommend  that continues  with home exercise program  and wearing  his hand
splints and AFO to maintain  range of motion  of his limbs.
® We recommend  that continues  his standing  program  with his neck collar, bilateral
AFO and knee immobilizers  to optimize  bone health and hip alignment.
e Monitor  for any pain and difficulty  when performing  perineal  care and hygiene.
@ Postural  change over 24hours/  day in the form of frequent  turning  and sitting in custom-
fitted wheelchair  to prevent skin sores and limit further skeletal deformities  such as
scoliosis. :
e Nutrition:  Continue  feeding  via gastrostomy  and monitor  weight.

SPECIALIST  MEDICAL  REPORT
The abovementioned  is a 4-year-old  with a background  of Leigh's  disease  associated
with epileptic  spasms  and other chronic  medical  problems.  The patient  underwent  a
Vagal Nerve Stimulator  (AspireSR  Model 106) insertion  by the Neurosurgical  Service,
KK Women's  and Children's  Hospital on 14 October  2019. Intra-operatively,  no
complication  was encountered.  His immediate  post-operative  period was stable, Upon
review  of the wound  on 04 December  2019, if was noted to have healed  well. Clinically,
there was no new clinical  deterioration  or neurological  deficits. In addition,  the patient
was referred  back to the Neurology  Service  for long-term  management  of his device.
He was provided  a follow-up  appointment  with the Neurosurgical  Service  in 2 years
from his last appointment  (04 December  2019),
However,  the patient was readmitted  from 09 December  2019 to 14 February  2020
under the Paediatric  Medical  team for medical  complications  secondary  to infection.
During this period of treatment by the medical tearn, there was no related
neurosurgical  issue. Therefore,  the Neurosurgical  Service  was not actively  involved  in
his management  then. Moving forward,  we will continue  to follow up the patient  with
the rest of his multi-disciplinary  tearm in the outpatient  setting as needed,
