Dear UAE Embassy 
This letter provides an update of
He has been admitted since 10 Feb 2020 for acute graft versus host disease of his gut, a 
complicat ion related to his recent allogeneic stem cell transplant for his lymphoma on 
20/8/2019. 
He has responded to the treatment given to him and is making good progress. We may be 
able to discharge him within the next few days. However, he is NOT FIT to fly back to his home 
country yet, as he still needs very intensive and regular outpatient follow-up and treatment. 
There is a possibility that his acute GVHD may flare and he might need to be hospitalised . 
As this is a serious post transplant related complication that may be lethal if not monitored or 
treated by an experienced transplant team, we strongly discourage him to fly back to his home 
country now, 
Thank you for your kind understanding.

Dear UAE colleagues : 
The above mentioned is a gentleman with relapsed refractory T cell lymphoma, currentlyin complete remission 
post allogeneic transplant from his matched related donor (brother). His post transplant course has been 
complicated by Grade IV Graft versus host disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which was steroid refractory. This 
has led to his prolonged hospitalization and need for parenteral nutrition as well as high doses of steroids . 
He is currently improving after nearly 6 weeks of intravenous steroids and use of second line agent ruxolitinib . 
Grade IV steroid refractory GVHD is potentially life threatening and necessitates management in a specialized 
transplant centre. His immunosuppression will need to be weaned off slowly and he will need to be closely 
monitored. In addition, he also has cytomegalovirus reactivation due to his immunosuppression medications and 
is currently on antiviral treatment. 
Given the complexity of condition, we would like to request to only send  back to UAE once 
his steroids are weaned off (this may take another 2-3 months) and his infective issues have resolved. 
Thank you very much for the understanding and please do not hesitate to conta ct me as necessa ry.

Dear Sir/Ma'am, 
was recently discharged from acute GVHD of his gastroin testina l tract. In the 
same admission , he was also treated for his CMV reactivation and virem ia. 
CMV PCR was trended and despit e on standard oral treatment with Valganc iclovir, the titre did not 
return to norma l and fastest results still showing a persiste ntly high titre results instead. 
We are concern of CMV drug resistance and have sent a test for it. Since it will take more than 2 
weeks before the results turn arou nd, we have decided to offer in treatin g him with CMV 
intravenous immunoglobu lin (/VIG), with hope to reduce the titre and to prevent the risk of 
reacti vation causing potenti al CMV disease. 
CMV IVIG is a high cost drug however , and he will require a dose of infusion twice a week, with each 
dose costing appro ximately SGD 2,000 (i.e. SGD 4,000 per week). 
This therefore is to seek you r permi ssion please, if we could proceed with the treatment as we 
foresee the poten tial benefi t over Mr Ahmed Khaled. 
Thank you for your support and cons iderat ion.
