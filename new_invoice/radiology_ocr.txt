F-18 FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE  PET/CT  STUDY
CLINICAL  HISTORY
is a 49 years old lady with ca right breast. She is status post wide excision  of the right breast in Jun
2022 followed  by chemotherapy  from Jul till Oct 2022 and radiotherapy  in Oct 2022. She has been receiving  Tamoxifen
since Apr 2023. PET/CT  to assess  disease  status.
TECHNIQUE
Positron  emission  tomographic  (PET) images,  coupled  with multi-slice  low-dose  CT scan were acquired  73 minutes  after
intravenous  administration  of approximately  281 MBq of F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose  (blood glucose  4.4 mmol/l).  CT was
used for attenuation  correction  and anatomical  correlation.
FINDINGS
Comparison  was made with the previous  PET study of 14 June 2022.
THORAX:
The patient  is status post wide excision  of the right breast. Surgical  clips are seen in the right breast.
Low-grade  physiological  glandular  FDG uptake  is noted in both breasts.
The density  of low-grade  activity  in the lower outer quadrant  of the right breast (im 3/174, maxSUV  1.7) is more in keeping
with post-surgical  change.

The low-grade  to mildly FDG-avid  cutaneous  thickening  overlying  the right breast is also in keeping  with post-treatment
change.
No abnormal  FDG-avid  focus is seen in the left breast.
The right axillary  nodes of negligible  to low-grade  activity  are more in keeping  with reactive  nodes (maxSUV  1.7).
No FDG-avid  internal  mammary  or mediastinal  nodes are noted.
The left axillary  nodes, bilateral  subcentimeter  lower paratracheal  nodes and subcentimeter  aortopulmonary  window  node
of negligible  to low-grade  activity  are more in keeping  with reactive  nodes.
No abnormal  FDG-avid  focus is detected  in both lungs.
The subcentimeter  nodule  in the left lung apex (im 3/111) is most likely too small to be accurately  resolved  on PET and is
indeterminate.
Mild scarring  is noted in the right lung apex, right upper lobe and right middle  lobe. No pleural  effusion  or pericardial
effusion  is seen.
Low-grade  to mild physiological  brown fat FDG uptake  is noted in the thoracic  paravertebral  fat planes.
HEAD  AND NECK:
No FDG-avid  supraclavicular  nodes are noted.
The mildly FDG-avid  right level Il cervical  node and left level II cervical  node (maxSUV  2.5) are most likely inflammatory  in
origin.
The other bilateral  cervical  nodes and bilateral  submandibular  nodes  of negligible  to low-grade  activity  as well as the non
FDG-avid  subcentimeter  submental  nodes are compatible  with reactive  nodes.
No abnormal  FDG-avid  focus is detected  in the cerebral  hemispheres  or cerebellum.  The paranasal  sinuses  and mastoids
are clear.
The low-grade  to intensely  increased  FDG activity  involving  both sides of the nasopharynx,  the soft palate, bilateral
palatine  tonsils,  base of tongue,  hypopharynx,  bilateral  aryepiglottic  folds, bilateral  vocal cords, bilateral  parotid  glands,
bilateral  submandibular  glands  and thyroid  gland is more likely to be physiological  or inflammatory  in origin.
SKELETAL  SYSTEM  AND SOFT  TISSUE:
The bone marrow  shows normal physiological  distribution  of FDG activity.
No abnormal  FDG-avid  skeletal  focus is detected.  The non FDG-avid  sclerotic  skeletal  foci in bilateral  femoral  heads are
most likely bone islands.
The low-grade  to mildly increased  activity  involving  bilateral  shoulder  regions  and the right sternoclavicular  joint  as well as
adjacent  to the right greater  trochanter  is most likely inflammatory  in origin.
ABDOMEN  AND PELVIS:
The low-grade  to mildly increased  gastric  activity  is most likely physiological  in origin.

The segmental  low-grade  to mildly increased  activity  along the sigmoid  colon, rectum  and small bowel loops is more in
keeping  with physiological  bowel uptake.
There are no FDG-avid  intra-abdominal,  retroperitoneal  or pelvic nodes.
The subcentimeter  ileocolic  nodes, subcentimeter  superior  mesenteric  nodes, subcentimeter  aortocaval  node,
subcentimeter  para-aortic  nodes, bilateral  subcentimeter  common  iliac nodes, bilateral  external  iliac nodes  and bilateral
inguinal  nodes of negligible  to low-grade  activity  are in keeping  with reactive  nodes.
The subcentimeter  hypodensity  in segment  II of the liver is too small to be accurately  characterised.  No abnormal  FDG-
avid focus is noted in the liver.
The subcentimeter  hypodensity  in the pancreas  is stable. No abnormal  FDG-avid  focus is seen in the pancreas.
No ascites  or FDG-avid  peritoneal  nodule  is noted. No abnormal  FDG-avid  focus is seen in the spleen,  adrenal  glands,
adnexal  regions  and uterus.
A tiny left renal calculus  is noted but no hydronephrosis  is present.  The right renal hypodensity  is most likely a cyst.
Physiological  urinary  activity  is seen along the urethra.
CLINICAL  IMPRESSION
The density  of low-grade  activity  in the lower outer quadrant  of the right breast  is more in keeping  with post-surgical
change.
The right axillary  nodes  of negligible  to low-grade  activity  are more in keeping  with reactive  nodes. Follow-up  is advised.
There is no scan evidence  of FDG-avid  recurrent  malignancy  detected  elsewhere.
